> hping3 at its basic is a network tool which can be used to send custom TCP/IP packets and to display target replies like ping program does with ICMP replies.  So its an icmp but with a lot of bells and whistls. 
> hping3 handle fragmentation, arbitrary packets body and size and can be used in order to transfer files encapsulated under supported protocols. Using hping3 you are able to perform at least the following stuff:

> - Test firewall rules  
> - Advanced port scanning  
> - Test net performance using different protocols,  
packet size, TOS (type of service) and fragmentation.  
> - Path MTU discovery  
> - Transferring files between even really fascist firewall  
rules.  
> - Traceroute-like under different protocols.  
> - Firewalk-like usage.  
> - Remote OS fingerprinting.  
> - TCP/IP stack auditing.  
> - A lot of others.

>At its core nslookup is a tool used to gain information from DNS server.
>Before you even play with nslookup you need to understand DNS and how exactly it works. The following link will give you a brief understanding of DNS.
>Nslookup is a window based utility and can be launched in two modes.
> - Interactive 
> - non-interactive
> 
> The interactive more is way more fun than the non-interactive one. Obviously, if you have a simple query you can get it done with non-interactive mode for e.g

    > C:\Users\a..........r>nslookup google.com
    Server:  $.$.$.$
    Address:  #.#.#.#
    
    >Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:    google.com
    Addresses:  2607:f8b0:4002:c02::71
              2607:f8b0:4002:c02::8b
              2607:f8b0:4002:c02::66
              108.177.122.138
              108.177.122.102
              108.177.122.139
              108.177.122.101
              108.177.122.113
              108.177.122.100

 But why be non-interactive when interaction is so much fun.

filtering specific traffic. Automatically extracts files for packet capture; it will also extract

images. It will also pull some credentials for specific sites. It can also filter out “keywords” to

allow for filtering of specific information being sent across the network.

### <u>Scanners</u>

**Nmap**: uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the

network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what

operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are

in use, and dozens of other characteristics.

>nmap -T4 -n -sS 192.168.0.1/24 # SYN

engineers.

### <u>Enumeration</u>

**DumpSec**: Reveals users, groups, printers, shares, registry info in an easy to digest human

readable format from a targeted system. Very useful for finding out intimate information

about the specific system for privilege escalation purposes.

**SuperScan**: Also used for enumeration. *See Scanning

**Netcat**: A simple tool that can read and write data across a TCP or UDP connection. It’s very

useful because it can create almost any type of connection. Including session binding. It

allows actors to create shell and reverse shell connections between two endpoint. Allowing

them to send / receive files and execute commands on both the host and compromised

systems. It has since lost support; consequently the Nmap project has incorporated an

upgraded version called Ncat. Other remakes: Socat, OpenBSD’s nc, Cryptcat, netcat6,

pnetcat, etc.

>nc -zv -w 1 google.com 21 # Scan google's port 21, -z scan, -v verbose, -w timeout

nc -lvp 6969 # Opens a server on 6969, -l listens, -v verbose, -p port 6969

ls -d google.com # Zone transfer

**DIG**: A network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System. dig is useful for network troubleshooting and for educational purposes. It can operate based on command line option and flag arguments, or in batch mode by reading requests from an operating system file.

>dig www.google.com

dig mx www.google.com # Get mail server entries

dig axfr @ns1.google.com www.google.com # Zone transfer

**NBTSTAT**: A diagnostic tool for NetBIOS over TCP/IP. It is included in several versions of Microsoft Windows. Its primary design is to help troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution problems.

password resetting over disk cleanup to virus scanning.

**Medusa**: Remote, speedy, modular brute force cracker for network services. HTTP, MySQL,

SMB, SMTP, SNMP, SSHv2

**Brutus**: Older remote password cracker.

### <u>Wireless Tools</u>

**Kismet**: A sniffing tools and also a multi-purpose wireless tool. It can be used for IDS and

many other things.

**inSSIDer**: Used to monitor local WiFi traffic and identify the channels different networks are

communicating on. It was originally designed for optimizing Office / Home network WAP

placement to reduce interference and produce the most optimal signals for the environment.

**Reaver**: WPS brute forcing tool. This tool waits to intercept the WPS beacon; once it’s

captured it will brute force the WPS PIN and the PSK password.

**Netstumbler (Old but useful on 32bit systems)**: Similar to inSSIDer, but not as feature rich.

**Bluesnarfer**: A tool used to steal information from a mobile device through the bluetooth

connection.

**Aircrack-ng**: Is a tool suite used to assess WiFi security. It focuses on monitoring, attacking,

testing and cracking a WAP. It can capture and analyze packets; create replay attacks,

deauthentication with injection techniques; test WiFi cards and their driver capabilities; and

**Splunk**: An enterprise tool used to store and parse logs on a large scale to monitor network

activity and functionality.

**SolarWinds**: An enterprise tool similar to Splunk, with the exception that it can create a

a live environment which reduces the need for static network topology tools like Vizio.

### <u>Other Tools</u>

**Snort**: A freeware IDS / IPS.

**Metasploit**: This is an automated framework capable of exploiting vulnerabilities with many

tools across many platforms.

### <u>Hardware Tools</u>

**Minipwner**: A small device that can be connected to the target network and left behind to

cord. It’s low power consumption allows the device to be used a WAP on battery power for

several hours.

**USB Rubber Ducky**: A flash drive that is recognized as a Human Interface Device (HID). It

can bypass most enterprise DLP software since the software thinks the device is a keyboard.

It is capable of running scripts and gathering data among many other uses that can be

dreamt up for it.

**Wi-Fi Pineapple**: A small discrete device that has powerful application for pentesting. It can

be used as a potential Evil Twin WAP. It comes with an impressive suite of applications that

helps to analyze the data collected by the device.

**LAN Turtle**: A Small USB-to-Ethernet adapter that can be placed on a victims computer

inside the target network. I can fingerprint and enumerate the network and be used to create

an SSH into the network. It can also spoof DNS entries on the network for a redirection /

session hijacking attack.

**AirPcap**: A USB designed to provide a hardware based pentesting tool. It works in

conjunction with other common tools. It can be used on wireless networks and may conduct

packet injection to active connections. It can function as an Evil Twin, or Rogue AP.
